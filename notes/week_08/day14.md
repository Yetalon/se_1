## Main objectives
1) Understand Agile as a **project management philosophy** (not a strict single process, and not “the wild west”) 
2) Understand the **Agile Manifesto values** and the nuance that the “right side” still has value 
3) Learn the **12 Agile principles** and what they imply about delivery cadence, collaboration, and technical excellence 
4) Learn about **Planning Poker** as an estimation technique you’ll use for an in-class exercise 
5) Recognize where you’ve already been “Agile-ish” in this course (self-organization, feedback loops, rhythm) 

---

## Objective 1 — Agile is (and isn’t)
Agile is presented as:
- A **philosophy of project management** 
And explicitly **not**:
- “the wild west” of development  
- a single specific process that must be followed (Scrum is mentioned as a specific process intended for a single dev team)  
- the absence of a plan or management  
- a guarantee of success 

**Added context:** Agile is a set of priorities and behaviors. A team can “do Scrum” mechanically and still fail to be Agile if they ignore collaboration, feedback, and adapting intelligently.

---

## Objective 2 — Agile requires organizational buy-in
The slide deck emphasizes Agile is an organizational thing:
- The **organization** must adopt the philosophies, not just the dev team 
- **Customers also have to buy in** (which is hard and requires significant alignment) 

**Added context:** If customers demand rigid contracts and fixed scope with no collaboration, the team can’t realistically “respond to change” in the Agile way.

---

## Objective 3 — The Agile Manifesto values (and the important last line)
The deck quotes the Agile Manifesto framing:
> “While there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.” 

The four values listed:
- **Individuals and interactions** over process and tools 
- **Working software** over comprehensive documentation 
- **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation 
- **Responding to change** over following a plan 

### Key nuance (the “most forgotten” part)
The deck warns teams often forget the last line: there is still value in process/tools, documentation, contracts, and planning—Agile just prioritizes the left side when tradeoffs happen. 

**Added context:** Think “balance with priority,” not “throw away everything on the right.”

---

## Objective 4 — Agile’s Twelve Principles (what they mean in practice)
The deck lists (across multiple slides) principles including:
- Satisfy customer through **early and continuous delivery** of valuable software 
- **Welcome changing requirements**, even late; harness change as advantage 
- Deliver working software **frequently** (weeks to months, prefer shorter) 
- Business people and developers work together **daily** 
- Build around motivated individuals; give support; trust them 
- Face-to-face conversation is most effective communication 
- Working software is the **primary measure of progress** 
- Sustainable pace; constant pace indefinitely 
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility 
- Simplicity: maximize the amount of work not done 
- Best architectures/requirements/designs emerge from **self-organizing teams** 
- Regular reflection + adjustment (retrospectives) 

**Added context (how to “see” these in a team):**
- Short iterations, frequent demos
- Tight feedback loops with a real customer proxy
- Strong engineering practices (tests, refactoring, CI) to keep shipping safe
- Regular retros where the process changes on purpose (not randomly)

---

## Objective 5 — Planning Poker estimation
The deck calls out a specific action:
- “Do some research on the estimation technique called **Planning Poker**. We will use a variant as part of the in-class exercise.” 

### Homework
**Homework:** Research Planning Poker before class so you can participate effectively. 

**Added context (what to learn for Planning Poker):**
- It’s a team estimation technique that uses relative sizing and discussion to converge
- The real value is surfacing assumptions and disagreement early

---

## Objective 6 — Agile all along (what you’ve already been doing)
The deck notes that in this course you’ve already been:
- self formed and self organized
- following a plan but responding to change as needed
- exchanging ideas and collaborating
- following a rhythm so expectations are clear
- keeping things conceptual vs dogmatic
- receiving frequent feedback on progress 

**Added context:** This is basically “Agile behaviors without necessarily using Agile branding.”

---

## In-class exercises — Calls to action
### In-class exercise: Planning Poker (variant)
You’ll use a Planning Poker variant for estimation during class (after doing the research).

## Optional material
The deck provides an optional reading on Agile leadership (external link listed on the slide).
