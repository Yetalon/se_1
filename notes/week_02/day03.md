## Main objectives
1) Understand the **four learning styles** and what they typically prefer/dislike 
2) Learn how to **leverage your own learning style** (and adapt when needed) 
3) See how the course intentionally targets multiple learning modes + repetition 
4) Build professional habits for **clear, effective email** and using email as a **document trail**

## Objective 1 — Recognize the four learning styles
The presentation uses a common “four styles” model: **Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic, Reading/Writing**. 

### Visual learners
- Prefer learning through **graphics, pictures, video, illustrations** (“Don’t tell me, show me”). 
- Often doodle to remember (instead of taking full notes). 
- Not fond of lecture-only or audio-book-only approaches. 

**Added context:** If you’re visual, convert text → diagrams: flowcharts, concept maps, or annotated screenshots.

### Auditory learners
- Prefer **audio books / podcasts** and often learn well in lecture-style settings. 
- Tend to be conversational, good presenters; sound can trigger memory. 
- Not fond of reading-only assignments or written-only instructions. 

**Added context:** If you’re auditory, “teach it out loud” (even to an empty room) to check understanding.

### Kinesthetic learners
- Learn best through **activities** and “putting concepts into action.” 
- Benefit from movement, breaks, active listening techniques; boredom hits faster when sitting still. 
- Not fond of puzzles/mazes or long sit-through media experiences. 

**Added context:** If you’re kinesthetic, your fastest learning often comes from “build a tiny version” + iterate.

### Reading/Writing learners
- Better retention with **note-taking** and **annotated reading materials**. 
- Prefer written directions and researching/writing over presenting. 
- Not fond of oral presentations or audio-only formats. 

**Added context:** If you’re R/W, you can turn lectures into “mini-chapters” after class—summary first, details second.

## Objective 2 — Use study strategies that match your style
### Core idea
The deck asks you to reflect: **Do you know how you learn?** Have you looked up strategies that fit your learning nature? 

### Instructor example (important nuance)
The presenter shares they lean Reading/Writing but have dyslexia, so they can’t both take detailed notes *and* listen—so they expand notes after class instead. 

**Added context (why this matters):** Your “best style” isn’t always what’s easiest in the moment. A good system often includes:
- your primary style (what retains best),
- a workaround for constraints (attention, time, accessibility),
- and a secondary style to reinforce learning.

## Objective 3 — Connect learning styles to how the course is run
The instructor says the course tries to support all four styles:

- **Visual:** illustrations, video before class, PowerPoint summaries. 
- **Auditory:** presenter notes written so a text reader can process; oral Q/A; students read responses aloud. 
- **Kinesthetic:** in-class exercises with writing ideas down + forming groups. 
- **Reading/Writing:** assigned/optional readings and in-class exercises. 

Plus: **repetition** via reading + exercise + quiz. 

**Added context:** This is a practical reminder not to judge yourself if one format doesn’t click. The course is intentionally multi-modal—use the parts that work best for you.

## Objective 4 — Write emails that are clear, professional, and safe
The email deck frames this as “Email in a professional setting,” with a **quick quiz** to check what you already know. 

The quiz prompts you to think about:
- When to use **BCC** vs **CC**
- Who belongs on **TO**
- **Subject line length**
- How many questions (max) to ask in one email
- Writing style, spellcheck, proofreading method
- Pronouns 

**Added context (practical interpretation):**
- **TO** = who must act/respond; **CC** = keep informed; **BCC** = protect privacy / avoid reply-all storms / discreet copy (use carefully).
- A good subject line is short but specific (so someone can find it later).
- Fewer questions per email usually means fewer dropped balls (bundle only if they’re tightly related).
- Proofreading: read once for meaning, once for tone, once for “logistics” (names/dates/attachments).

---

## Objective 5 — Create a document trail to prevent misunderstandings
The deck’s central email theme: create a **document trail** (“hindsight is 20/20… no time travel”). 

Key points:
- When something is only verbal, there’s risk of **he said/she said** or misunderstanding/misremembering (especially in meetings). 
- Solution: send a short “Just to confirm” email after a verbal instruction. 

The slide provides a template structure:
- Greeting
- Confirm conversation context (when/where)
- List captured requests + due date(s)
- Respectful close 

**Added context:** This is less about paranoia and more about reducing ambiguity. It protects *both sides* by making expectations explicit.

## In-class exercises — Calls to action

### In-class exercise: Learning style reflection
Prompt: write (briefly) how you learn best and what you can do to leverage it. 

Suggested structure (1–2 short paragraphs):
- My default style is: ___ because ___
- I struggle when: ___
- This week I will try: (two strategies) ___ and ___

### In-class exercise: Email “quick quiz”
Answer/discuss the quiz questions on BCC/CC/TO, subject lines, questions per email, proofreading, pronouns. 

### In-class exercise: Draft a “Just to confirm” email
Using the provided pattern, draft a confirming email for a made-up meeting request.

## Homework
No explicit “due” items were stated in these decks, so I’m not labeling anything as required homework based on the slides alone. (If your instructor assigns the reflection or email draft as a submission, you can move it from “In-class exercise” to “Homework.”)
